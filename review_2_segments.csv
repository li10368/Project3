going by the good words of my friends i hired this movie hoping that it would at least equal the laughs of the similar movie house party but i was very disappointed and very bored
br br falling asleep while watching a movie is never a good sign
i dont know whether this didnt appeal to me because i dont live in da hood or if im not black but its probably one of the two
br br it tries to spoof a few movies only coming up with a couple of laughs but in the long run it fails miserably
miss it
