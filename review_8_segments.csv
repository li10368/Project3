insignificance is a far from great film from a stage play directed by nic roeg
in the scheme of roegs films this is above the level of most of his postdont look now work which is characterised by judicious use of theresa russell as lead actress
shes actually very good here and far from the problem in other roeg films like bad timing and cold heaven
as the actress who is marilyn monroe russell is very effective portraying her as a thoroughly depressive but likeable siren
she plays well alongside michael emil as einstein who is excellent to say the least
he looks the part admirably and while theresa russell doesnt look exactly like monroe she certainly is attractive enough to make the part ring true
other players are adequate if not quite as arresting as emil and russell are
a pretty workable intelligent script is directed well by roeg but certainly not brilliantly like walkabout or performance
as in other later roeg films he tends to rely too much on vague insubstantial flashbacks that add very little to the film
in many ways the film would have worked better as a shorter say minutes more modest piece
still a quite acceptable passable film
at times quite excellent but somewhat lacking overall
