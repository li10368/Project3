there is nothing in this that the viewer could point to and call good
the acting was dull and sedated
the sets and cinematography look like they were developed by someone grew up in a starbucks and tried to make the perfect gap commercial
characters have no drive motivation or reason for us to care about them
theres such a lack of interest and tension that its hard to follow the banal action and dialog
and the plot
if anyone finds it im sure it would be as boring as everything else
br br this isnt funny its not romantic it doesnt reflect on the human condition
if you want a good stoner comedy watch halfbaked if you want a good stoner drama watch trainspotting
the only reason i gave this stars instead of one is because its kind of fun seeing some familiar faces in the midlate s cast
which is a shallow reason to give the film even one star but then again this is a shallow movie
