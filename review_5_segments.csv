i saw the film at the brooklyn international film festival world premiere
br br a haunting intimate portrait of loneliness and the repercussions of letting it grow and turn into something darker
br br the acting of the two leads jessica bohl richard brundage is excellent and makes one wish you had met these characters before they became so damaged
br br reminded me in theme of the works of atom egoyan exotica and raymond carver where im calling from
br br the soundtrack tywanna jo baskette crooked fingers is excellent and reinforces moments in the film without drawing attention to itself
br br highly recommend the film and the soundtrack
