i really enjoyed this old black and white talkie
at first i didnt recognize harold lloyd as mr
cobb a missionary to china coming home to find a wife
there were many twists and turns in mr
cobbs attempts to clean up city hall
his methods of making the punishment fit the crime would likely be illegal but this is not a movie based on reality
this would be a perfect movie for children except that there is female near nudity pasties only on grace bradley
the old telephones are enchanting
the only fault is a problem typical of the day caucasians are used to represent chinese men
this is offset by the positive way the chinese are portrayed
they are the wise good and friendly guys
trivia a bekins truck appears in the movie when the police run out of black marias
