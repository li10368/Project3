its cheesy its creepy its gross but thats what makes it so much fun
its got over the top melodramatic moments that are just plain laughable
this movie is great to make fun of
rent it for a good laugh
br br the film centers around three women newscasters during a time way before cellphones
they go to a small town to cover a festival but they cant get a room to stay the night
and thats when they meet ernest keller
hes creepy in a psycho kind of way
and he offers to let them stay at his home
but he doesnt tell them the truth about who lives there
br br stephen fursts performance is so amazing as the unseen that he really carries this film
most of the movie is kind of dull although finding out the truth of ernests family is kind of interesting
br br just seeing this cast in these scenes makes it worth a look
barbara bach and doug barr make nice eye candy
br br i consider the movie an old gem hard to find and worth a look
