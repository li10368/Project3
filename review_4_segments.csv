the basic idea behind dungeon of harrow isnt all bad
the acting however is bad
the lighting is bad
the music is bad
the scenes of torture are without emotion
there really isnt much there to recommend this film
you know what kind of a movie youre in for when the credits say special guest star and list someone youve never heard of
might as well say rex hamilton as abraham lincoln
because theres really no one in this movie you can identify
there are one or two decent moments mostly toward the end and i think the basic plot outline may have contained an original idea but that alone is not enough to keep you awake through this otherwise inept yawner
