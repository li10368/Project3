weve all played halo and socom and gta and resi etc
but none of them can stand up to ge
the game itself is great
i have literally burned out my n playing this great game along with zelda oot
this game along alone built the mold that is essential for all modern shooters
on top of that the multiplayer is great
the story mode itself is worth playing a hundred times over and more
its a great game for when your board and you want to just shoot up some people and there are endless unlock ables
cheats aztec egyptian god knows how many multiplayer charries and the three difficulties as well as the famous difficulty our modern games are great but when you sit down and play this game you get a certain feeling that few other games can give you
and with the online capabilities of newer shooting games we rarely see this old two on two death match style
and when we do its no where near as good as this games
and when you get bored of the story there are endless mysteries glitches and easter eggs to be found and taken advantage of
br br this is definitely one of the greatest shooting games of all time
