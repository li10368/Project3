ok
so its a lowbudget film i used the quotes because it was shot in hi video
the acting is universally horrid the makeup is laughable the blood looks like it came from sherwinwilliams and ive seen more convincing bruises made from halloween ghoul kits and the lighting generally looks like they used someones borrowed toyota pickup to shine headlights on the actors
br br i might be able to forgive these lowbudget traits if there were some actual content if a movie made an attempt to tell a story
but this collection of video footage can boast of no plot no real characters and no momentum
its a selfindulgent mess
br br and dont worry no spoilers here cause theres absolutely nothing to spoil
