having just wasted a couple of hours watching this and for of that time in complete disbelief i can give this garbage the turkey of the year award no problem
to say the plot was unbelievable is some big understatement
frankly i am lost for words to describe this utter tripe
not only are the characters completely and utterly without any semblance of originality this sort of stuff has been done much better in dozens of serial killer flicksbut the acting was dire
for those who pay to see this i hope you get your money back for those who were paid to do this i hope you give your money back
believe me folks there are many new releases out there that are much much better
go see
